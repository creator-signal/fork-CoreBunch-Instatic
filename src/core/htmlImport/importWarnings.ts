 * `<instatic-loop data-source-id="…">` carries a string that must name a
 * registered loop source. Nothing checked it: the id was copied verbatim into
 * props, `site_insert_html` reported success, the document persisted intact,
 * and at publish time `loopPrefetch` turned the unregistered source into a
 * well-formed `{ items: [], totalItems: 0 }` — indistinguishable from "this
 * table is empty". The section rendered as nothing, and every gate passed,
 * because the route still returned 200 with a title and an h1.
 *
 * These are warnings rather than hard failures. A paste of thirty elements
 * should not be rejected wholesale for one mistyped attribute, and the
 * importer also serves arbitrary user-pasted HTML. What matters is that the
 * caller is TOLD, at author time, instead of finding an empty section in a
 * screenshot weeks later.
